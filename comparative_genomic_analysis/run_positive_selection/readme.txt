In this directory, different subdirectories store the results of positive selection for different group. 
After running run_multiple_paml_site1.pl and run_multiple_paml_site2.pl in both site1 and site2 subdirectories, 
executing 'perl sum.pl dirname' will yield the statistical results of the positive selection analysis.
